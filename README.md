# React Webapp Shell v1.0

This is a webapp shell intended for use with some in-person hiring exercises here at agilon.

## Development
This project consists of main two folders `client`, and `server`. The `client` directory is where the code will live for our UI which will be written using [react](https://reactjs.org/). The `server` directory is where the code will live for our API/server side code. 

### Installing project dependencies
In the root of this project you can simply run

```
npm ci
```

This will install `node_modules` in the root of this project as well as both the `client` and `server` folders.

### Starting up the project
Once your have installed dependencies you can start up both the frontend and backend of this project by running the following command at the root of this project

```
npm start
```

> Note: you can always run the `client` and `server` in separate terminals by moving directly into each folder. The `npm start` command at the root is just meant to be helpful not required.
